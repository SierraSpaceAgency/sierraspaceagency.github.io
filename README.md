#### Dev
* Check out the `dev` branch
Do not use master- it is a build-only branch

#### Deploy
* npm run build
* npm run deploy

The build will bundle up all the assets into a kind of ugly output, and put it directly on master. It is deployed. But note: sometimes GitHub hiccups and loses track of the custom domain. Always verify https://sierraspaceagency.com and make sure the repo settings are pointed to that url.
